2. EU-RATE SHEET DETAILED ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════

✅ Erwerbsschwelle (Purchase Threshold) - CORRECT
  • Values properly differentiated by country economic size
  • Examples:
    - Small economies (Cyprus, Malta, Estonia): 10,000-10,251
    - Medium economies (Germany, France): 100,000-125,000
    - Large economies (Bulgaria, Romania): 20,000-34,000
  • Thresholds realistic per EC guidelines

✅ Lieferschwelle (Supply Threshold) - CORRECT
  • Properly aligned with purchase thresholds
  • Most EU countries: 35,000 EUR
  • Exceptions realistic:
    - Bulgaria: 70,000 BGN (~37,000 EUR equivalent)
    - Poland: 160,000 PLN (~40,000 EUR equivalent)
    - Denmark: 280,000 DKK (~37,500 EUR equivalent)

✅ WAE (Currency) - CORRECT
  • Proper currency codes for all countries
  • EUR members: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Rep., Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain
  • Non-EUR: Denmark (DKK), Poland (PLN), Sweden (SEK), UK (GBP)
  • No errors detected

✅ Kto-Nr (Account Number) - CORRECT
  • Sequential numbering 4000-4027 for EU countries
  • 28 accounts for 28 entities (27 EU + UK)
  • Proper mapping to country codes

✅ Land-NR (Country Number) - CORRECT
  • Unique identifier per country
  • Values: 1, 2, 3, 4... up to 246
  • Some non-sequential (246 for Cyprus) - indicates historical data, but consistent


3. POTENTIAL ISSUES & WARNINGS
═══════════════════════════════

⚠️ MINOR: UK Included as EU Member
  • UK is listed with Code "UK" and status as EU member
  • Reality: UK left EU on 31.12.2020
  • Action: Consider removing or marking as "Historic/Reference only"
  • Impact: LOW (data integrity issue only, VAT rate still correct at 20%)

⚠️ MINOR: Greece Code "EL" vs Standard "GR"
  • Sheet uses "EL" (ISO 639-1 language code for Greek)
  • Standard should be "GR" (ISO 3166-1 country code)
  • Reality: Both used in EU systems, but "GR" is standard
  • Action: Consider correcting to "GR" for consistency
  • Impact: LOW (might cause lookup errors if using standard GR)

✅ ALL OTHER FIELDS: CORRECT
  • No mathematical errors
  • No threshold mismatches
  • No currency code errors
  • Naming consistent (German names for LAND column)


4. OTHER SHEETS QUICK AUDIT
════════════════════════════

Sheet 3 (CODE_INDEX):
  ✓ Account numbers properly structured
  ✓ German descriptions accurate
  ✓ Hungarian translations present (Fogalom column)
  ✓ Structure allows for country-specific accounting

Sheet 4 (Steuercodes):

  ✓ Descriptions match country context

Sheet 6 (Länder):
  ✓ Country master data complete
  ✓ German/English names consistent
  ✓ Country numbers properly assigned


5. RECOMMENDATIONS
═══════════════════

PRIORITY 1 (HIGH - Fix soon):
  1. Remove or mark UK as non-EU
     Current: "United Kingdom | UK | 20 | Großbritannien"
     Action: Delete row or add note "HISTORIC - UK left EU 31.12.2020"

PRIORITY 2 (MEDIUM - Improve):
  2. Change Greece code from "EL" to "GR"
     Current: Code = "EL"
     Recommended: Code = "GR"
     Reason: ISO 3166-1 standard compliance

  3. Add "Effective Date" column to EU-Rate
     Current: No indication when rates became effective
     Recommended: Add column "Effective_From" (e.g., "2020-01-01")

PRIORITY 3 (LOW - Documentation):
  4. Document threshold update frequency
     Add note: "Thresholds updated annually per EC VAT Directive"
     Current: No metadata about data currency

  5. Add VAT rate change history
     Current: Only current rates shown
     Recommended: Keep audit trail of rate changes

Data Accuracy:
  ✓ VAT rates: 100% correct (28/28)
